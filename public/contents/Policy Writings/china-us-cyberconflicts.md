# A Brief Introduction to US-China Cyberconflict in 2021

## Chinese Interest in Cyberspace

In 2021, the Chinese Communist Party released the 14th Five-year Plan. The plan outlined several national security and economic goals that may affect China&#39;s development of cyber capacity.

First, the plan called for measures to improve the resilience of critical energy, agricultural, and financial infrastructure. These measures include strengthening the security of electricity grids, developing domestic technologies to decrease reliance on imported seeds, and monitoring financial technologies against fraud and systematic risks. These measures mainly involve increasing the defensive capacity of national infrastructure.

Second, the plan decreed &quot;modernization&quot; of the military and more collaboration between military and civilian technologies. The &quot;modernization&quot; of the military involves building capacity in &quot;cutting-edge, disruptive&quot; technologies, which presumably include cyber technologies. It also procures cyber talents and develops military applications for civilian cyber technologies.

Finally, the plan envisioned the rapid development of critical cyber technologies and deeper integration of cyber technologies in traditional industries. These key technologies include:

- High-end computer chips
- Operating systems
- Key algorithms in artificial intelligence
- Sensors and other IoT devices

Developing these technologies requires intensive financial and time investments, which are already underway. The Chinese government has funded cybersecurity exercises and training programs through formal and informal channels. Private sectors in China closely collaborate with the government to advance national interest domestically and internationally. These goals also incentivize the private and public sectors to build offensive cyber capacity for cyber exploits and espionage operations.

## US-China Relation and Interactions in Cyberspace

Currently, tension is mounting between China and the US. However, the rivalry between the two countries is not simple. In addition to ideological differences, the complexity of US-China relationship rises from the economic integration between the two countries. As the world&#39;s two largest economies, China is the largest trading partner for the US and most of its allies. China also relies on many US technologies to develop its domestic industries. Beijing understands that reliance on US technologies is a national security concern as rising tension leads to more economic sanctions from the US. However, Beijing also wishes to build an economic environment attractive for foreign investors, on the one hand out of financial incentive, on the other hand using foreign reliance on the Chinese economy as bargaining power in negotiations.

Under these premises, China engages in extensive cyber espionage operations to decrease its reliance on US technologies and increase its economic advantages. These operations affect both private and public sectors. Past targets of these operations include private companies such as Google, academic institutions, and government infrastructures such as the Office of Personnel Management. Assets compromised include trade secrets, intellectual properties, and personal identification numbers. Since the distinction between cyber espionage and cyberattack is vague, these operations also indicate that China has the capacity to cause significant disruption to information systems in the US.

## Current US Cyber Strategy

In 2019, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) was established to propose provisions to enhance the US&#39;s cybersecurity. In 2020, the commission proposed 82 recommendations broadly categorized into six groups:

- Reform US government&#39;s organization and structure for cyberspace.
- Strength norm and non-military tools.
- Promote national resilience.
- Reshape cyber-ecosystem towards greater security.
- Operationalize cybersecurity collaboration with the private sector.
- Preserve and employ the military instrument of power.

The CSC&#39;s comprehensive cyber strategy proposal requires enormous input from stakeholders across the US government, Congress, and the private sector. While the recommendations are being implemented efficiently by the standard of the US government, threats in cyberspace are evolving at a far greater pace. In the meantime, foreign adversaries are expected to utilize existing vulnerabilities to gain advantages in certain areas.

In addition, the DoD&#39;s Cyber Command has been actively engaging with foreign threat actors, including state-sponsored actors in China. General Nakasone described opponents&#39; attack patterns as &quot;corrosive threats,&quot; which contain continuous, grey-zone operations such as influence campaigns and IP thefts. The Command counter with &quot;persistent engagement,&quot; conducting various operations to understand foreign threat actors&#39; capacity and intention. While the results of these operations remained classified information, Chinese security organizations have attributed many attacks on Chinese targets to US government-affiliated groups. Such attacks are expected to be more frequent and devastating than those disclosed since the Chinese government tends to suppress public disclosure of cybersecurity compromises.

## Assessment of Impact on China&#39;s Cyber Strategy

Assessing the impact of US cybersecurity efforts on China&#39;s cyber strategy is not an easy task due to the increasingly uncertain bilateral relationship and the lack of public records in past actions and decision-making processes. Here we propose two possible responses.

First, China is expected to continue its cyber exploits and espionage activities due to growing demands for economic and technological independence. Chinese economy is under pressure from increasing labor costs, slowing domestic demands, and international sanctions. The pressure is especially intense in the tech industry, which has been the frontrunner of Chinese economy in the past decade. For Beijing, procurement of key technologies monopolized by the US and its allies through any means necessary is crucial to reviving the domestic tech industry. Given China&#39;s record in cyber operations, there is no reason to expect such activities to cease.

Second, in response to the US&#39;s increasingly aggressive stance toward foreign cyber operations and more resilient cyberinfrastructure, China is expected to conduct more targeted operations to limit the scope of retribution and increase the effectiveness of attack. China has no interest in large-scale cyberattacks that inflict economic damages, such as ransomware attacks, nor is it interested in meddling with US domestic politics through cyber operations. These attacks are hardly relevant to Chinese national interest. The cost of these attacks is also expected to increase as the US improves its cybersecurity and conducts counterattacks against prominent threat actors. Instead, Chinese cyber operations often aim to obtain information and avoid attribution. As the cost of high-profile cyberattacks on US targets increases, China may design attack vectors that are highly tailored to the target and therefore much less detectable.
