# Cybersecurity Profile: Belgium

*Jeff Qiu*  

## Summary

Belgium is a highly developed country with a robust cyber defense capability. Home to essential institutions in the European Union and the headquarter of NATO, Belgium&#39;s cyber defense benefits tremendously from collaborations with allies in these international organizations and private security providers outside its border. However, Belgium&#39;s strategic position in Europe invites frequent cyber espionage and cyberattacks from powerful adversaries, particularly China and Russia.

## Country Background

Belgium is located in Northwest Europe, bordering the Netherland in the north, France in the south, and Germany and Luxemburg in the east. The country consists of three highly autonomous regions: the Dutch-speaking community in the northern Flemish region, the French-speaking community in the southern Walloon region, and the densely populated Brussel-Capital region. In 2022, the country has a population of 11.2 million. 

Belgium has a highly developed economy. As of 2021, Belgium has the 13th highest GDP per capita in Europe, above the UK and France. Breaking down by sector, 77% of the country&#39;s GDP comes from the service industry, with manufacturing and agriculture, respectively, making up 22% and 1%. Belgium is an early adopter of the internet and remains highly connected. In 2018, Belgium ranked 6th globally in internet speed. Belgium&#39;s internet penetration rate stood at 91% in 2021, with 76% of the population being active social media users.

## Cyber Assets and Capabilities

### European Union

Belgium is a founding member of the European Union and is considered the de facto capital of the union. Three of the four most important EU institutions are located in Belgium. The European Commission is the executive branch of the EU, the Council of EU ratifies bills initiated by the Commission, and the European Council provides strategic guidance for the union.The EU institution&#39;s network is managed by the Belgian internet service provider BELNET, which also provides service for the Belgian government.

As an EU member state, Belgium is under the effect of EU cybersecurity regulations. The 2016 Directive on Security of Network and Information System (NIS Directive) mandated member states to establish their national CERT team, set up a &quot;cooperation group&quot; to exchange incident information with other EU members, and maintain governmental supervision on critical sector infrastructures. Belgium responded quickly to the EU directive. Belgium&#39;s CERT team was established in 2002, and the government incorporated mandatory cyber incident reporting in critical sectors into the national legal framework in 2019. The 2019 EU Cybersecurity Act further increased the role of the EU in Belgium&#39;s cybersecurity, empowering the EU Agency for Cybersecurity to aid member states in times of large-scale cyberattacks.

### NATO

NATO&#39;s headquarter is located in Belgium. The headquarter hosts member states&#39; military representatives and is occasionally visited by the most senior military officer in member states&#39; defense forces. While the headquarter houses sensitive military intelligence that may invite cyberattacks on the Belgian network, the defense of NATO&#39;s internal network is handled by NATO&#39;s internal CERT team (NATO Computer Incident Response Capability) rather than a Belgium entity. There is little information on how the presence of NATO headquarters directly benefits or compromises Belgium&#39;s network. Nonetheless, NATO&#39;s internal network remains a crucial cyber asset for Belgium, given its strategic importance.

Belgium&#39;s membership in NATO gives the country access to several valuable technical and political resources to develop its national cyber defense capabilities. First, NATO member states&#39; cyber defense agencies regularly conduct cyber exercises, exchange threat information, and assist each other in cyber incidents. Second, NATO manages training facilities within several member states, such as the NATO Communication and Information Academy in Portugal, which provides training to military personnel. Finally, NATO recognized that &quot;significant malicious cumulative cyber activities&quot; may be considered an armed attack and trigger an elevated response from the alliance, ensuring member states&#39; cyber safety through deterrence.

While the extent to which Belgium utilizes these resources is unknown, access to NATO-exclusive resources could only benefit Belgium&#39;s cyber defense posture. Belgium&#39;s commitment to national resilience under the NATO Cyber Defense Pledge could also incentivize the government to adopt cybersecurity measures more quickly.

### The Belgium government

The Belgium government is highly digitalized. Launched in 2002, federal portal Belgium.be allows Belgian citizens to access online essential public services such as taxation, electronic ID, and healthcare. Different agencies are responsible for the storage and processing of data related to their fields of responsibility. The Department of Transport, for example, manages data related to vehicle registration, separated from the social security data stored by the Department of Social Security. However, the majority of personal information is held at the National Register of Natural Persons, a register managed by the Ministry of Interior. The database hosts the most sensitive citizen data that would interest nation-state hackers, some of which are discussed in later sections.

Several government agencies help ensure the safety of Belgium in cyberspace.

- The Center for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) was established in 2014. Similar to the CISA in the US, the CCB remains the most important coordinator of cybersecurity in Belgium. Consisting of 37 employees, the center operates the country&#39;s official CERT team, CERT.be. It also organizes cybersecurity events and training, participates in international events such as the Las Vegas DEF CON, and coordinates cybersecurity efforts between the government and the private sector.
- The Belgium Military contains a cyber component that provides conventional cybersecurity capabilities such as digital forensics, malware analysis, and penetration testing. It regularly participates in NATO&#39;s cyber exercises, although its performance is never published. The military plans to upgrade its cyber capacity by upgrading the cyber division to a full-fledge defense unit alongside the Air, Land, Navy, and Medical division by the end of 2022. The elevated cyber command will likely join forces with Belgium&#39;s military intelligence to develop much-needed offensive cyber capacity.
- The Federal Computer Crime Unit, operating under the Belgium Federal Police, is responsible for domestic civilian cyber incidents such as cybercrimes, terrorism, and hacktivists. In significant cyber incidents, such as the recent attack on the Port of Antwerp, the police are often the entry point for larger-scale investigations.
- The State Security Service (VSSE) and the General Information and Security Service (GISS/AVID) are the two primary intelligence agencies in Belgium. The VSSE is a civilian agency under the Minister of Justice, while the AVID is a military agency under the Minister of Defense. Under the oversight of the 1998 Special Intelligence Method Act (&quot;the BIM law&quot;), these agencies use wiretapping extensively in their counter-terrorists and counter-espionage operations, mostly against domestic targets. Both agencies participate in undisclosed intel sharing networks with intelligence agencies in allied countries, including the NSA. Unlike their US counterpart, however, Belgium&#39;s intelligence community currently depends on allies for cyber intelligence due to limited technical expertise, sometimes even on domestic intel.

### The Private Sector

Belgium has a promising tech industry as well as a growing cybersecurity presence. According to a survey of investors familiar with Belgium&#39;s emerging tech sector, Belgium tech startups are attractive to investors because the country&#39;s diverse demography sets businesses up well for international expansion. Belgian and European investors recognize the increasing importance of cybersecurity and have pledged more funding opportunities. In 2020, the European Cybersecurity Organization, a Brussels-based industry group, allocated a $1.18 billion fund to promote the growth of local cybersecurity firms.

While domestic cybersecurity companies are still in infancy, Belgium&#39;s cyber infrastructure benefits from collaboration with private companies from around the world. French cybersecurity company Thales, for example, has a long-standing partnership with the Belgium Ministry of Defense to provide the ministry with cybersecurity training and incident response capacities. Belgium&#39;s Cyber Security Coalition, one of the largest public-private collaboration platforms in cybersecurity, brings together global companies such as Accenture and EY with public sector organizations, including the EU commission and CERT.be.

### Critical Infrastructure

Belgium&#39;s critical infrastructures are protected under the EU&#39;s 2016 NIS directive and Belgium&#39;s 2019 NIS Act. Together, the two pieces of legislation identified six critical sectors that &quot;must take the necessary and proportionate technical and organizational measures&quot; against potential cyberattacks, in addition to mandatory reporting of suspicious cyber incidents.

Similar to the US, critical infrastructures in Belgium are mostly operated by private companies. Operators of these infrastructures, in addition to adhering to policy guidelines, often rely on third-party solutions to strengthen their security. A few examples are:

- Belgium operates the Port of Antwerp, the second-largest port in Europe and the 14th largest port in the world. The port is highly digitalized and progressively utilizes new technologies such as drones to improve the efficiency of its daily operations. It fields its own cybersecurity team and purchases third-party cybersecurity products to ensure resilience on all components of the network, from the smart devices used by port workers to the data-sharing platform facilitating communications between shipping companies.
- Belgium&#39;s most significant source of energy is nuclear. Both of Belgium&#39;s nuclear power plants, constituting half of the country&#39;s electricity supply, are operated by the French company ENGIE. The cybersecurity of the plants is mainly maintained through an air gap between the reactor&#39;s operating system and the PC network used in the facilities, combined with a strict security procedure to prevent unauthorized physical access to the system.
- Belgium&#39;s hospitals have been proven to be vulnerable to cyberattacks. In 2021, a cyberattack locked up 80 computers and canceled 100 appointments in a hospital in Tournai, a western town in Belgium. Since then, the Ministry of Health has been developing a comprehensive cyber plan for hospitals in Belgium. Some of Belgium&#39;s hospitals also enlist the help of private security companies to harden their defense. The largest hospital in Belgium, UZ Leuven, uses products provided by a British company to detect threats in their systems.

## Cyber Threats and Vulnerabilities

### Cybercrime

Belgium faces increasing threats from cybercriminals. Belgian citizens and businesses are lucrative targets for cybercrimes due to the country&#39;s high income and connectivity. In a 2020 survey of Belgium companies, 52% of respondents claimed to have been targeted by cybercriminals in the past year. Incidents reported include slander on social media to more damaging attacks such as ransomware and data extortion. However, the survey also found that company employees often perpetrate these crimes rather than professional criminals.

Another study in 2022 found that Belgium ranks fourth in countries most targeted by cybercrimes, with 94 Belgians per million internet users falling victim to attacks such as phishing or ransomware, costing victims more than $30,000 on average. Both sets of data suggest the necessity to increase cybersecurity awareness among citizens and a more refined legal framework to combat cybercrimes.

### Allies

Belgium once found itself a victim of a close ally. In 2014, NSA whistleblower Snowden disclosed that the UK compromised Belgacom, one of the largest internet service providers in Belgium at that time. According to the leak, the GCHQ used spear-phishing against Belgacom&#39;s network engineers to embed malware, allowing the British government to maintain a presence inside private networks run by the telecom.

Although cyber espionage from allies is a legitimate form of cyber threat, how these operations affect Belgium&#39;s national security is not obvious. Allies frequently conduct espionage on each other, but these acts are rarely considered a form of aggression, sometimes even regarded as necessary for the security of the countries involved. In addition, some of Belgium&#39;s allies, such as the US and the UK, control the most advanced cyberweapon in the world. Even if the Belgium government deems defending against these threats necessary, it may not have the appropriate resource to develop the defense.

### China

Belgium is a valuable target for Chinese espionage operations due to the country&#39;s strategic location within Europe. In recent years, Chinese agents have been pushing changes in EU regulations that to fast-track Chinese investments in member states, primarily through recruiting Europeans working in the institutions as lobbyists. Belgium, hosting meetings between senior EU and member state politicians, is the best place to gain a foothold in the EU. In 2020, the foreign affairs wing of the EU issued an alert to member states that there were about 250 Chinese spies living in Brussel. A shortlist of European collaborators swayed by these spies include Belgium includes a German EU ambassador, the former chair of the Belgian federal parliament&#39;s home affairs committee, and the constructors of Malta&#39;s EU embassy in Brussel. European authorities have struggled to counter the increasing influence of China due to the entangling interests and legal ambiguity.

China&#39;s increasingly frequent influence campaigns in Belgium correlate with a rise in sophisticated cyber operations against the Belgium government. Although not officially attributed to Chinese entities, these attacks either reflect characteristics of known Chinese operations or directly serve the Chinese government&#39;s interest. In a 2021 investigation, security researchers discovered that a &quot;highly sophisticated adversary&quot; attempted to compromise Belgium&#39;s interior ministry back in 2019. If successful, the attacker could have access to Belgian citizens&#39; personal data, including profession, election information, and unique identification numbers to request information from other government-run databases. While investigators refused to provide attribution, the attack is reminiscent to the OPM hack in 2014, in which Chinese hackers exfiltrated confidential files of US federal employees for intelligence purposes. Later in the same year, the Belgium government suffered a massive DDoS attack just before the parliament was set to hear the testimony of an Uyghur human rights activist. The attack successfully disabled the government&#39;s network for several hours and led to the cancellation of the hearing.

Chinese actors are also active in disinformation campaigns in Belgium, but for economic reasons. In 2021, in response to a bill banning Huawei equipment in Belgium, Huawei began hiring Belgian lawyers to publish pro-Huawei articles and use fake accounts on Belgian social media to turn public opinion in Huawei&#39;s favor. Unlike state-sponsored cyber operations that illicitly target government systems for espionage purposes, the campaign is an entirely private effort for commercial gain rather than political ones. While Huawei&#39;s campaign was badly executed and did not achieve its intended goal, it could serve as a warning for Belgium about future Chinese online influences and broader information warfare techniques.

### Russia

Russia&#39;s relationship with Belgium could only be described as &quot;paradoxical.&quot; On the one hand, Belgium&#39;s commitment to NATO and the EU made a cardinal biliteral relationship difficult as the two organizations hardened their stance against Russia in the past decade. On the other hand, Belgium continues to take advantage of Russia&#39;s energy and diamond export to boost its own economy despite EU-level sanctions and the invasion of Ukraine.Otherwise, Russia&#39;s interaction with Belgium is largely defined by the broader Russia-EU relationship.

While Belgium may not be Russia&#39;s top priority, Russia still has an interest in destabilizing Belgium&#39;s democracy. In 2020, Belgium intelligence agencies warned that several groups are spreading disinformation regarding COVID-19 and immigration on social media platforms. These groups, manifesting extremist political ideology and pro-Russia narrative, are suspected to be under Russian influence. This disinformation campaign remains the only known Russian cyber exchange with Belgium in recent years, until the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when Belgium finds itself facing increasing cyber threats from Russian actors.

At the beginning of the invasion, Belgium&#39;s CCB issued a statement warning Belgian organizations about potential cyberattacks from Russian-supporting hacker groups. With Belgium joining allies&#39; economic sanctions against Russia, the statement said, Belgian organizations could potentially face targeted retaliation and should continue to develop cyber defense capacities. While this warning may not indicate a looming cyberattack, it is a reminder that Russia remains a tangible cyber threat to Belgium.

Russian attackers are interested in energy infrastructures. As sanctions mount, energy is Russia&#39;s one of the few remaining ties with Europe. Cyberattacks on European energy infrastructures could put pressure on European countries attempting to limit their energy import from Russia. While Belgium&#39;s energy supply does not depend on Russia, the Port of Antwerp is the fifth largest fuel port in the world. The attack on Port of Antwerp in March 2022 likely originated from a ransomware group rebranded from Darkside, the East European ransomware group behind the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack.

NATO is another important target in Belgium for Russian attackers, especially during military conflict. In March 2022, Google Threat Analysis Group reported that a Russia-based group is attempting to use Gmail to phish credentials from NATO officials in Europe. Compared to indiscriminate attacks like NotPetya, the campaign seemed more targeted and may have a less direct impact on Belgium&#39;s cyber infrastructure. However, it showcases Russia&#39;s interest in compromising NATO&#39;s network through cyber operations, which put Belgium at risk.
