# A Case for Irresponsible Cyber Offense

*Jeff Qiu*

In the article &quot;Responsible Cyber Offense,&quot; the author suggests that the US should &quot;promote verifiable, technical norms for responsible offensive cyber operations&quot; and negotiate &quot;reciprocal agreement to not use irresponsible techniques&quot; with its main adversaries, namely Russia and China.

While the technical suggestions are sound, the policy implementation is nearly impossible. The main obstacle is that there will not be an open agreement on how to hack responsibly until countries openly acknowledge having conducted cyber operations. In addition, properly designing cyberweapons may not be in the adversary&#39;s interest since reckless attacks can have unique benefits and may not invite a more severe response than a carefully orchestrated attack.

First, most US adversaries are unwilling to admit that they conduct cyberattacks, making public agreements on operational norms impossible. The Russian government has refused to take credit for the SolarWinds hackand NotPetya, while China repeatedly denied conducting cyber operations and claimed they &quot;oppose all forms of cybercrimes.&quot; We do not have reasons to believe that these countries would change their narrative. On the one hand, obscurities in cyber attribution make denying responsibility easier. Due to the sensitive nature of most cyber operations, the US also rarely publicly discloses critical evidence that provides credibility to attribution. On the other hand, admitting to conducting cyber operations runs contrary to the two countries&#39; cyber strategies. Here we discuss China as an example.

For China, acknowledging its cyber offensive capability goes against the long-standing denunciations against cyberattacks in general, as well as their effort to establish itself as a responsible international cyber power. China has been increasingly active on the international stage to promote its vision of &quot;internet sovereignty,&quot; which opposes foreign nations meddling in any sovereign country&#39;s internal network.

The gesture has won China supports from regimes that are wary of western dominance in cyber technology and brought China substantial economic benefits in addition to public image boosts. Many African countries, for example, have embraced Huawei technologies and Chinese telecommunication standards as part of China&#39;s Digital Silk Road initiative. Publicizing its own aggression is opposite to China&#39;s diplomatic stance on cyberspace governance and would alienate countries subscribing to the belief. Neither of these is in China&#39;s diplomatic interest.

If a public agreement is unfeasible, could countries abide by a US-led norm through other means? If government negotiation is the only communication channel, a norm is unlikely to be enforced. To begin with, governments evaluate the damage wholistically when responding to a cyberattack. Responsibly executing a cyberattack does not guarantee a more lenient response from the victim, therefore adversaries do not have additional incentive to constrain their behavior. When the attack itself is damaging enough, the adversary may not have an incentive to avoid the spillover beyond what is necessary for the attack&#39;s success. In response to the NotPetya malware outbreak, the US and its European allies used its usual &quot;naming and shaming&quot; method to publicly attribute the attack to Russia.

The Equifax hack, a more carefully executed operation by Chinese military personnel, received a DoJ indictment against identified hackers instead. The Chinese hack, while properly executed, clearly deserves a more elevated response due to its impact on US national security compared to NotPetya, which had a primarily economic effect outside of Ukraine. Similarly, the US may be less worried about whether the attackers used a hospital network as a pivot point if the attack seriously affected national security interests.

An indiscriminate attack can also offer unique benefits. Experts have speculated that the Chinese government is using data of US persons to train machine learning algorithms to gain advantages in the AI race.

In the Microsoft exchange attack, the large scale of the attack creates opportunities to follow up with ransomware or data exfiltration in victims lacking the resources to patch in time, such as small businesses. While these real-world data may not directly impact national security or trade secrets, they are invaluable to training better AI, which is core to China&#39;s national interest. While such attacks also put critical infrastructures at risk, being selective with the targets of follow-up attacks can decrease the possibility of escalation. If third-party attackers manage to inflict damages, the cost for China will depend entirely on the US&#39;s willingness to impose consequences beyond the attackers. Overall, the benefit of an indiscriminate attack outweighs its direct cost.

The author claims that states have interests in limiting the damage caused by irresponsible cybercriminals within their border out of fear of escalation. However, governments should not worry about reckless cyber operations &quot;accidentally&quot; escalating into physical conflicts. Granted, large-scale cyberattacks between major powers, such as Russian hackers disabling the electric grid of the entire US west coast, could lead to dangerous escalations. Such advanced threat, however, is unlikely to come from a non-government regulated group. If a group does have such a dangerous capacity, its government already has enough incentive to regulate it without being prompted by the US. A poorly designed malware causing such devastating consequences is equally unlikely, given how much effort has been put into hardening the US&#39;s critical infrastructure. If a cyberattack warrants a physical response, we can safely assume that the attackers are acting on behalf of their government, and the government is expecting an escalated response.

Nonetheless, forcing adversaries to adopt responsible offensive behaviors is beneficial to the US. While it is hard to exert pressure from the policy side, offensive cyber operations against foreign adversaries may be effective. There are few public records documenting the efficacy of US cyber operations against Russia, but we see the Biden administration shifting away from diplomatic or legal retaliation to &quot;a series of clandestine actions across Russian networks&quot; in response to the SolarWinds hack.

Perhaps instead of attempting to engage in open conversation about responsible hacking, the US should maintain cyber norms by carefully imposing costs on irresponsible adversaries. Responsible hacking is a technical problem, which means a technical response may be more appropriate.
