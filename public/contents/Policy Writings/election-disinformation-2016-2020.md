# A Brief Comparison of Election Disinformation in 2016 and 2020

## Disinformation during the 2016 Election

In the 2016 election, domestic conservative media was a primary source of election disinformation. Before the election, conspiracy theories and fake news that promoted Trump and discredited Clinton dominated the political narratives within online and traditional conservative media groups. Breitbart, a news website that has worked closely with known alt-right political figures to promote conspiracy theories such as "Pizzagate," was one of the most engaged news media on Facebook.  Traditional conservative media were also complicit in spreading disinformation: Sean Hannity, a host for Fox News, made a series of disputable claims during the election that alleged voter fraud, which Trump on Twitter promptly echoed.  These contents' attention has influenced broader the conservative media circle to pivot for more extreme political narratives.

Analyses have agreed that social media played a substantial role in amplifying disinformation in the election process. During the three months leading up to election day, fake news from Facebook news pages generated 1 million more engagement than mainstream media.  On Twitter, Breibart's articles have been shared almost 40,000 times, topping the Washington Post and Politico as the 4th most shared political news publisher on the platform.  Politically polarizing content is viral on these platforms because the recommendation algorithms favor controversial, attention-grabbing content, leading to the contagious spread of disinformation.  

Another source of disinformation was from foreign organizations, most notably the Russian government and its affiliated groups. Before the election, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), an organization tightly connected to Russian military intelligence, ran a disinformation campaign to sow discord in American society. The agency controls fake social media accounts disguised as US political and civil organizations to create a favorable environment for Trump and exacerbate conflicts between domestic interest groups. For example, the IRA-controlled Twitter account "TEN_GOP" posed as the official account of Tennesee Republic Party to falsely claim that Clinton committed voter fraud during the Iowa Democratic caucus.  Another IRA-controlled Facebook page, "United Muslim for America," fabricated quotes from Clinton in which the former secretary of state claimed her support for implementing Sharia law in the US.  In addition to the IRA, some social media groups operate independently outside of the US for monetary gains. In Northern Macedonia, teens created Facebook pages that share fake pro-Trump information to profit from ads and merchandise sales.  

The Russian disinformation campaign was politically motivated. The Russian government was concerned with Clinton's aggressive diplomatic stance against Moscow and expected Trump to bring a more favorable US-Russia relationship.  A Trump presidency may lead to tangible political benefit for the Russian government, which warrant a large-scale disinformation campaign against Clinton. The Russian government also sought to undermine the legitimacy of the democratic election process in the US, which they find to be ideologically threatening to authoritarian regimes. 

## Changes in the Aftermath of 2016 Election

Perhaps one of the most crucial changes was the increase in public awareness of disinformation. Thanks to the protracted battle between Trump and the mainstream media after the 2016 election, public attention for election disinformation has increased significantly. Google trend shows that search interest in the term "fake news" has jumped twenty times post-2016, while the word "disinformation" has received twice as much more attention in the months leading up to the 2020 election.  Researchers have also dedicated more energy to the identification, impact, and mitigation of election disinformation. The number of publications related to disinformation in 2020 is five times more than in 2016, mainly due to a wealth of funding opportunities from both the private and public sectors. 

Social media platforms have rolled out various measures to counter disinformation following the 2016 election, responding to government pressure and public demand. While Facebook initially denied the existence of Russian campaigns on its platform, it eventually acknowledged the problem and began working with investigators.  In 2017, Facebook announced an increased effort to verify the authenticity of accounts and limit the exposure of pages with a history of sharing false information.  In preparation for the 2020 election, the company also included fact-checking labels under shared articles, banned ads suppressing voter turnout, and introduced dedicated security tools for political candidates.  Meanwhile, Twitter announced an increase in their investment in technical solutions against future disinformation campaigns such as machine-learning algorithms to detect bot account activities.  The platform also employed a labeling scheme for tweets regarding election results and COVID information similar to Facebook and encouraged users to comment before retweeting an article.  

The federal government has also taken steps to address disinformation. Before the 2020 election, the CISA under the DHS deployed several measures targeting election-related disinformation, including establishing the Mis, Dis, Malinformation taskforce, setting up a dedicated rumor control page addressing common rumor in the election cycle, and creating a series of educational resources such as graphic novels and guidelines.  The intelligence community demonstrated initiatives with the establishment of the FBI-led Foreign Influence Task Force overseeing investigations of foreign attempts at influencing the US election process and suspicious election information on domestic social media platforms.  

## Disinformation during The 2020 Election

In 2020, election disinformation continued to circulate within domestic right-leaning media. Research focusing on a false ballot dumping claim in Sonoma, CA, found that the story mostly recycles within a group of densely interconnected conservative websites before receiving a retweet from Trump when it reached a broader audience.  The new round of disinformation emphasized less on the conspiracy theories targeting candidates and more on the election procedures, especially mail-in voting. In addition to Trump's relentless attack on the safety of mail-in ballots, far-right conspiracists used robocalls to suppress voter turnout in Michigan by falsely claiming that mail-in voting discloses voters' private information to the government.  

Social media platforms' more aggressive stances against disinformation in the 2020 election have mixed results. In November, after the election result came out, Facebook banned the group "stop the steal" that claimed widespread election fraud and called for protests across the country. Twitter contributed to the effort by changing its algorithm to limit the exposure of the tag used by the group.  However, these measures were insufficient to prevent the movement from gaining momentum and cumulating into the January Capitol Hill Riot. The rioters chanted "stop the steal" to demonstrate their affiliation with the movement that social media tried to censor.  Facebook claimed that it continued to remove content that called for violence after the election. However, as late as March 2021, researchers could still find more than a hundred Facebook pages with nearly 27 million cumulative followers supporting armed riots. 

Although less influential than the previous campaign, disinformation from foreign entities existed in the 2020 election. The Intelligence Community evaluated that organizations connected to the Russian government collaborate with Ukrainian politicians to spread conspiracy theory about Biden's business connection in Ukraine.  The conspiracy theory was acknowledged by Trump's campaign team, who sought to add credibility to the story by having US media publishing it.  However, the IC pointed out that, unlike in 2016, no evidence suggests that foreign influence has infiltrated the election infrastructure or the candidate's devices. The FBI also revealed that Iranian actors posed as alt-right group Proud Boys to threaten voters to undermine Trump's re-election prospect. 

Several reasons might explain the shift from foreign disinformation to domestic ones. First, federal agencies were more prepared to defend against foreign influences. In addition to CISA's #Protect2020 initiatives, the DHS and the IC have collaborated more closely with the private sector and the public in monitoring disinformation.  These countermeasures may have deterred blatant disinformation campaigns from state actors. Second, social media platforms' more aggressive policy towards account authentication may have increased the cost of coordinated information operations. However, the recommendation algorithm remained unchanged, and disinformation circulating within the US was mostly left unchecked. Third, homegrown disinformation regarding election frauds was more fitting to the US political and social reality, allowing it to overshadow the Russian smear campaign against Biden. The necessity to vote en masse via mail-in ballot during the pandemic and Trump's relentless attack on the election process made claims for election fraud less distant than Biden's corruption in Ukraine. 

## Policy Implications

First, government agencies and election officials should recognize that foreign election influence is a new norm and expand current efforts to defend elections against foreign actors. On the offensive side, the government can raise the cost of foreign election interferences through consistent offensive cyber operations and diplomatic pressure. Defensively, the government should harden election infrastructure and provide necessary cybersecurity supports for election candidates. Government should also promote public/private collaboration on foreign disinformation issues, such as sharing threat information or encouraging private companies to report suspicious activities on their platform.

Second, social media platforms should expect to adjust towards a business model that prioritizes quality of information rather than attention. One of the main reasons that enable the spread of domestic disinformation is the content recommendation algorithms that promote clickbait content. Such mechanisms are core to social media platforms' business model that directly profit from user attention. Unless platforms that facilitate these political discussions abandon the revenue model, disinformation will continue to plague the users. Alternative models, such as public-funded platforms, have been discussed by academics.  Government initiatives can help implement these models and kick-off changes in the social media industry.

Finally, digital media literacy should be incorporated into the education framework to ensure the quality of political discourse in future elections. Digital media has become the main avenue of information for the younger generations. The overwhelming amount of political information makes the ability to consume information selectively and critically a vital skill. Government can mandate public schools to hold media literacy classes, teaching teenagers to identify disinformation and maintain online civil discussions.
