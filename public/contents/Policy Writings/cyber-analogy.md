# Cyber Analogies Revisited

*Jeff Qiu*

## Analogy #1: Pearl Harbor

The analogy&#39;s conclusion that any &quot;major&quot; cyberattacks &quot;will only happen in the context of a serious political crisis&quot; is questionable. First, a &quot;major&quot; cyberattack is very different from a &quot;major&quot; kinetic attack. Their severity should therefore be evaluated differently. Among the long list of known cyberattacks between nation-states, few have caused direct physical damage to the target. Cyberattacks may have lasting political consequences, such as the 2015 OPM hack by China and the 2016 Election Interference by Russia, or have a significant impact on an ongoing kinetic attack, such as Russia&#39;s invasion of Georgia in 2008. But we have yet to see a cyberattack that has caused Pearl Harbor-level physical devastation. While we will consider all cyberattacks mentioned above to be &quot;major&quot; given their relative impact, they remain distinct from a &quot;major&quot; attack within a physical context.

This is not to say that cyberattacks will forever operate under the line of physical aggression. In light of the recent invasion of Ukraine, NATO emphasized that a cyberattack against a member state could lead to the deployment of conventional force. A recent Microsoft report also shows that Russia is operating its cyberattacks &quot;with restraints&quot; within Ukraine to avoid spillover into neighboring countries, a departure from their strategy in the 2017 NotPetya attack. Their actions suggest that, despite its lackluster record of success, Russia recognizes a NATO physical response to Russian cyberattacks as a real possibility. Policymakers cannot live under the comfort of &quot;cyber war will not take place&quot; and disassociate prospects of unprecedented cyberattacks from physical escalation.

The clarification of what constitutes &quot;major&quot; cyberattacks is important in understanding whether a &quot;serious political crisis&quot; is a prerequisite for such attacks. Unlike the strike on Pearl Harbor, cyberattacks can undertake important strategic roles during peacetime. China, for example, has launched a number of major cyberattacks targeting the US government and private sector with meaningful success. Yet, despite remaining one of the most significant cyber threats to the US, China maintains a diplomatic relationship with the US, and the two countries remain each other&#39;s top trading partners today. Major cyberattacks, as defined above, do not seem to require a hostile political environment like the US-Japan relationship in 1941.

The reverse is also true: &quot;serious political crisis&quot; may not necessarily lead to more cyberattacks. With the invasion of Ukraine, Russia&#39;s relationship with NATO states has drastically deteriorated. However, the intensity of cyberattacks from Russia against these states has not proportionally increased. There are sporadic reports of unsuccessful attempts and warnings for potential future attacks against NATO states, but confirmed reports of attacks are rare. It is likely that Russian cyber capabilities are tied down in Ukraine or that Russia is trying to avoid confrontation with NATO on cyber fronts. Either way, cyber is just one of the many means to undermine rival states&#39; security postures, and the decision to deploy cyberweapons takes more factors into consideration than just political confrontations.

As a closing remark, the analogy mentioned that the US response to the attack on Pearl Harbor proves that a crisis may provide a valuable window of opportunity to clear political obstacles and upgrade defensive capabilities. This lesson is less applicable to cyber since the loose correlation between cyberattacks and political hostility diminishes the benefit of rushing cyber defense policies during any particular crisis. However, cyberattacks pose a persistent threat regardless of the political environment, making cyber defense a long-term investment that deserves constant attention. In the US, the rate of defensive cyber policies passed depends less on the threat landscape and more on the administration&#39;s priority. The current congress, for example, has introduced more than 80 cybersecurity bills in its first year, far exceeding the number in the entirety of the previous administration. However, as congress expedites bills responding to the conflict in Ukraine, cybersecurity bills have not received the special attention enjoyed by bills on imposing sanctions and providing arm assistance. Without signs of unprecedented cyber threats from Russia, congress is unlikely to mobilize to improve cyber defense in the same way it did for sending military aid to Ukraine.

## Analogy #2: Nuclear Escalation Ladder

The nuclear escalation ladder is a theoretical framework consisting of 44 nuclear or conventional warfare scenarios. Focusing on the tension between the US and the USSR, it aimed to codify a state&#39;s escalation behavior associated with each scenario in order to articulate the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The analogy points out that the framework fits poorly into cyber conflicts due to the lack of consensus on definitions. This is a valid argument, but the reasons for such disagreement require more articulation.

Cyber espionage and cyberattacks are two common terms used to categorize malicious cyber activity. One possible way to distinguish the two is the last step of the activity: both cyber espionage and cyberattacks involve the lengthy process of breaking into a system and establishing a foothold; but if the attacker chooses the exfiltrate the data and leaves the functions of the system untouched, it is an incident of cyber espionage; whereas if the attacker disturbed the normal functioning of the system, it is a cyberattack. However, the line is extremely easy to cross, as the execution of these two operations overlaps significantly.

The confusion between the two terms illustrates the difficulty in drawing thresholds for cyber operations. In the nuclear escalation ladder framework, the difference between each threshold is relatively defined, with each step a clear escalation from the one below. These subtle differences, such as whether a nuclear weapon was used on a military or civilian target, provide the basis for justifiable responses that both the attacker and the attacked can recognize. This is not the case in cyber. Cyber operations involve information that only has subjective value. Is leaking the security clearance of US federal employees, for example, a more severe offense than secretly maintaining access to systems in several federal agencies? Objectively quantitating the value of national security intelligence is impossible, let alone comparing it to the prospect of future attacks. As a result, any cyber operation that does not involve physical damage would struggle to find its place on the ladder.

Even if the thresholds are adequately identified, crafting a cyber response proportional to the damage is difficult. The nuclear escalation ladder assumes that for any asset hit by a nuclear strike, an asset of equal strategic importance on the opposite side could serve as the target for retaliation or escalation. Most cyber conflicts, however, are asymmetric. Attackers may simply not control assets as important as the target they attacked. The US, for example, may not find it worthwhile to hack a North Korean movie production company in response to the Sony attack since no North Korean company could match the value of Sony or the US&#39;s national security. Situations like this render the traditional model of equivalence exchange almost useless.

However, effective response is very much possible both in and out of cyberspace. Theoretical frameworks modeling nuclear exchanges attempt to define thresholds as precisely as possible due to the extreme cost involved in every nuclear attack. The material costs of cyber conflicts, on the other hand, are relatively much lower. The concept of proportionality in the cyber context should therefore be adjusted accordingly. In a 2018 report, the US Cyber Command observed that &quot;well-defended terrain is continuously at risk,&quot; and effective responses involve &quot;continuously engaging our adversaries.&quot; Reflecting on past experience, the Cyber Command seems to imply that any cyber operations are proportional to each other. The effectiveness of this strategy in deterring threats is unknown to the public. Still, it at least mitigates the danger of a physical escalation from cyberattacks, judging by the lack of such events in the past four years.

Non-cyber responses are also effective against cyber threats. In the past, the US has responded to cyberattacks with a variety of legal, diplomatic, and economic measures, sometimes in addition to hacking back directly. For example, in response to Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, the US shut down the Russian-funded agency responsible for the operation, charged key actors for breaking US laws, and imposed cybersecurity measures for future elections. Although none of these efforts involved an offensive cyber operation, they yielded promising results in the 2020 presidential election, which the CISA concluded to be &quot;the most secure election in American history.&quot;


The failure of the analogy implies different approaches to establishing consensus in nuclear and cyber conflicts. Since no one wants to start a nuclear war, a consensus on nuclear can only come from credible signaling of intent, such as officially adopting a framework like the escalation ladder. Consensus in cyber conflicts comes from the conflicts themselves, which is more credible than any form of signal. In other words, the nature of nuclear exchange necessitates an escalation ladder, while the nature of cyber conflicts does not.
